634:effects of leading edge bluntness on flutter characteristics of some square- planform double-wedge airfoils at a mach number of 15 .4.   results are presented from a wind-tunnel investigation in helium flow at a mach number of 15.4 .  the models were square-planform, double-wedge, shaft-mounted airfoils with leading- and trailing-edge radii of 0, 1, 3, and 6 percent chord . in general, the tests indicate that bluntness effects on the model flutter characteristics are stabilizing as the leading-edge radius is increased from 0 to destabilizing with further increase in bluntness .   results of flutter calculations made by using newtonian theory aerodynamics and a combination of newtonian theory and piston theory aerodynamics in conjunction with an uncoupled two-mode analysis are compared with experimental results . the piston-theory results accurately predicted flutter speeds for the models with
360:lift on inclined bodies of revolution in hypersonic flow . the importance of body lift lies in the fact that at moderate angles of attack and high mach number it can constitute an appreciable part of the total lift of a winged missile . in this paper an attempt has been made to analyze body lift in hypersonic flow by an approximate method and, together with a correlation of existing experimental data, to indicate the probable variation of body lift over a wide range of mach numbers extending from low supersonic to hypersonic . the method of analysis of hypersonic flow over inclined bodies of revolution employed herein has been denoted as the hypersonic approximation . it is an improvement on the newtonian corpuscular theory of aerodynamics, since it considers the centrifugal forces resulting from the curved paths of the air particles in addition to the impact /newtonian/ forces .
284:the divergence of supersonic wings including chordwise bending .   the static aeroelastic stability or divergence problem is investigated for thin supersonic wings when not only the spanwise bending and twist are taken into account but also the chordwise bending .  the problem is treated in successive phases of increasing complexity from the two-dimensional curling-up of the leading edge to the three-dimensional stability of the cantilever wing .  several methods of approach are developed including the nonlinear aspects of the structure and the aerodynamics . results indicate a strong dependence of stability on poisson's ratio and the magnitude of the deformation .
11:similar solutions in compressible laminar free mixing problems . there are in supersonic aerodynamics many situations of practical interest wherein streams of different velocities and, in general, different stagnation pressures mix with one another . in the majority of these problems the interaction between the two streams takes place in the presence of an axial pressure gradient .  its effect on the characteristics of the mixing may influence significantly the performances of the devices wherein the phenomena cited above occur .  a theoretical and experimental program of research to study mixing in the presence of axial pressure gradients is being carried on at the polytechnic institute of brooklyn .
753:development of a quasi-steady approach to flutter and correlation with kernel-function results .   the quasi-steady approach to flutter utilizes experimental or theoretical steady-state aerodynamic data to arrive at increased understanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases, acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictions . circulation lag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping is included in the evaluation of the air forces .  situations requiring the inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimation are specified .   a quasi-unsteady approach is also discussed, in which the approximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutter is included in simple modifications of quasi-steady parameters .   closed-form solutions are derived for the flutter characteristics of a typical section with and without rate aerodynamics . application is then made to the rational flutter analysis of three-dimensional multi-degree-of-freedom lifting surfaces .   a specific planform is evaluated in the mach-number range from zero to two .  quasi-steady, quasi-unsteady, and kernel-function results are compared subsonically .  quasi-steady results are utilized supersonically .   primary applications of the quasi-steady approach are in the areas of preliminary design and parameter-variation studies, modification of more sophisticated flutter theories to force compatibility with available steady-state data, and flutter evaluation of complex configurations which can be rationally analyzed by steady-state aerodynamic theories, but for which no complete unsteady aerodynamic theories are presently available .
